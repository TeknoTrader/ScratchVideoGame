As first project of the Harvard CS50, I made a videogame with the program "Scratch". 

The videogame logic is very simple: the more you can avoid the baloon to touch the corners, the more you'll be able to last.
To do that, you can use a planet that you can move with your mouse.

Here you can find the [videogame link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1046877598/).
I hope it is going to be fun!
